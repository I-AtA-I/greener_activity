# activity-filler

A simple Bash script that allows crontab to run another script which automatically creates commits on a schedule (default: every 2 hours).
This results in regular GitHub activity on a dedicated “streak” repository under your account.

Why use this?
-
Not everyone has the time or energy to publish or update a repository every single day — and that’s completely normal.
However, when you only commit once every few days (or once a week), your GitHub activity graph may not accurately reflect your overall consistency or interest in development. Since GitHub profiles are often reviewed in technical contexts, visible activity can sometimes matter.
This script is intended for people who:
Want a simple way to maintain consistent GitHub activity
Are experimenting with scheduled Git + cron automation
Prefer having a continuous activity streak on their profile

Or simply want a clean, green activity chart :)
