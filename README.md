# activity-filler
A simple bash script that lets crontab launch another script uploading a commit every 2 hours to newly created "streak" repository giving you an activity on YOUR github :)

Why use this?:
-
Some people dont really have the time/energy to publish a file EVERY single day, which isnt that bad, but when you dont really have the time to publish it more than once a week, that might be a problem in the future, such as finding a IT focused job as A LOT of companies look at the activity on your profile, if you are in this group of people I was talking about, this is EXACTLY why to use this                                                                                  
[ or you just want a pretty green activity chart :) ]
